# UFO sightings 
## The Truth is out There

## Purpose and Overview of the UFO sightings analysis
   The UFO sightings webpage was created to serve as a useful, convenient tool for the ufo-enthusiasts as well as ufologists. The webpage supplies the ability to see the documented ufo sightings all around the world. The filters available help the individual to see the date a sighting was documented, where, and what shape it was.
## Webpage User-Help
Interacting with the webpage is simple. Users can decide if they want to use all the filters or just the ones of their choice. All fields do not have to be filled out in order to elicit results.    
- First enter in a date using the format :1/1/2010. Once you press the enter key the data will be updated to show the results with the correct filter applied.
- Secondly if you’d like to apply a filter in addition to the first filter then you can move down the line. Each filter has an example for how to input the filter correctly. Once you press enter it with apply.
- Lastly if you need to clear the filters and start over you would just have to refresh the webpage on the top left corner next to the webpage link.


## Ufos Sighting Summary
  In conclusion this is a great webpage where there is a lot of data about ufos in one spot. Ufo-enthusiats do not have to scroll through a google search where there are thousands upon thousands of results. The sightings are all compiled in one place and the filters help the users narrow down their search even more. However, one drawback to the webpage is that the sightings are not backed up by another source. It would be helpful for the user to know who submitted the sighting and if it is credible. I suggest adding another column to the table with a link to more information about the sighting. 
There are two additions I’d make to the webpage to advance it.
Firstly, adding a clear filters button would be useful, instead of the user having to refresh the webpage. 
Lastly it would be helpful to the user if they could save their searches with the filters they applied. Once their search is saved their would be an option on the page to go back to a certain search. In doing this they would save their time by not having to go back and remember their past searches.
